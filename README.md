# dog_exploration_3Dtracking
Data and R scripts for the study entitles: "Using machine learning to track dogsâ€™ exploratory behavior in presence and absence of their caregiver"

## 01_dog_tracking_data_processing.Rmd
* Data processing (filtering, interpolation, smooting) and calculation of the summary stats for each trajectory (e.g., interest area durations, area covered, etc.)
* Plotting of individual keypoint trajectories and of Figure 2 and 4

## 02_dog_tracking_analysis.rmd:
* Analysis of the aggregated response variables (distance travelled, tail movements, area covered, visual angle to owner chair, duration in owner IA, duration in stranger IA, duration in door IA)
* Correlation between behavioral and survey (c-BARQ) data
* R script underlying Figure 1

## saves folder
* saved analysis outputs including tables for the proportion tracked data and the model outputs

## graphics folder
* all data visualisations (Figure 2-5)
* interpolated subfolder: all preprocessed individual trajectories (for each subject, key point, and condition)

## data folder
Includes all data files supporting the analyses.
* distance_travelled_summary_data.csv: aggregated tracking data for analysis
* 3D_tracking_object_locations_chairs_plates: location of chairs and plates for visualisation
* 3D_tracking_object_locations_chairs_plates_centers: location of chair and plate centers for analysis
* dog_tracking_project_data: demographics data and assignment to conditions
* survey subfolder: c-BARQ data
* detector2 subfolder: raw data (loopy output), one file per trajectory (for each dog and condition)
